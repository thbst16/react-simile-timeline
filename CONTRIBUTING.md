## Coding Style

- Use TypeScript with strict mode
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint/Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Avoid `any` types without justification

## Commit Messages

We use conventional commits. Format:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(timeline): add zoom gesture support`
- `fix(events): correct date parsing for BCE dates`
- `docs(readme): add theming examples`

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: Vitest for component and utility testing
- **E2E tests**: Playwright for browser-based testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Run unit tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run E2E tests with UI
pnpm --filter demo exec playwright test --ui
```
